This repository demonstrates a common Swift programming error: type mismatch in function arguments. The `calculateArea` function is defined to accept integer arguments, but an attempt is made to pass a string.  The solution shows how to correct the error by ensuring correct data types are passed to the function. The example highlights the importance of type safety in Swift.
